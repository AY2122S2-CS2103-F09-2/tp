### Project: Amigos

Amigos is a desktop application to help tech-savvy university students manage their friendships by helping them to keep
track of important details. It is optimized for use via a Command Line interface while still having the benefits of a 
Graphical User Interface (GUI). The user enters commands through the GUI which is built using JavaFX. 
It is written in Java and has over 10kLoC.
